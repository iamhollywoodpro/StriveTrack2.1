# 🎉 StriveTrack 2.0 Media System - FIXED! 

## 🚨 **ISSUES RESOLVED**

### ❌ **Previous Problems:**
1. **Progress photos showing as placeholders** instead of actual images
2. **Delete functionality not persistent** - deleted media returning on refresh  
3. **404 Not Found errors** on all media URLs
4. **Upload/download cycle failing** immediately after upload

### ✅ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED & FIXED:**

The issue was in the **Cloudflare Worker's wildcard route parameter extraction**:

**Problem:** Hono framework `c.req.param('*')` was returning `undefined` for wildcard routes  
**Solution:** Extract object key directly from `c.req.path` and decode URI components

**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
let objectKey = c.req.param('*')  // Returns undefined
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
const fullPath = c.req.path
let objectKey = fullPath.replace('/api/media/', '')
objectKey = decodeURIComponent(objectKey)  // Properly decode %2F to /
```

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL DETAILS**

### **The Fix Applied:**
1. **Updated all wildcard routes** in `media-worker/src/index.ts`:
   - `GET /api/media/*` (user media streaming)
   - `DELETE /api/media/*` (user media deletion)  
   - `GET /api/admin/media/*` (admin media streaming)
   - `DELETE /api/admin/media/*` (admin media deletion)

2. **Fixed R2-D1 sync logic** to use R2 as source of truth:
   - Clears stale D1 entries that don't exist in R2
   - Re-populates D1 with actual R2 files
   - Prevents phantom media entries

3. **URL encoding handling** - Properly decode URI components in object keys

## ✅ **VERIFICATION RESULTS**
